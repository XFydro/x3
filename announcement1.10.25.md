# Announcement: Stopping the development on MEv0.45
## 1.10.25
Hello everyone...,

After much consideration, I have decided to stop development on Minteclipse. This was not an easy decision, as the development on MintEclipse has been a major personal project for a long time, but it has increasingly become a source of frustration, stress, and mental exhaustion for me.

Even after trying to keep up with the development, the project’s complexity and ongoing issues were negatively affecting my mental health. I realized that continuing to push through these problems was unsustainable and was no longer bringing joy that it once did.Development on MintEclipse was fueled by anxiety and stress, but i have finally decided to priortize my mental health first.

I want to sincerely thank everyone who supported Minteclipse. Your encouragement has meant a lot to me, knowing how much time i spent on this makes this even harder.MintEclipse will now be sent to the deprecated versions sinkhole, However, Sardonix will now be my main priority, a lighter and more manageable interpreter for X3. My goal with Sardonix is to create something enjoyable, stable, and an actual working interpreter instead of a mess that MintEclipse had become.

Thank you for understanding and being patient to read this far.

i am tired, and i cant even enjoy the things i liked anymore

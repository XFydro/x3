2. **Navigate to the Directory**:

    ```sh
    cd interpreter_x.x
    ```

3. **Run the X3 Interpreter**:

    ```sh
    python <interpretername>.py "-f" "your_script.x3"
    ```

4. **Set Up in VS Code** (optional):
   - Install the X3 Runner extension from the vscode extension marketplace, and click the "run" button on a opened x3 file window. 

### Hello World Example

Below is a simple "Hello World" program written in X3:

```x3
prt "hello world"
```

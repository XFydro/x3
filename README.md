## 🚀 Overview

The **X3 Documentation** is an online resource dedicated to providing comprehensive guidance on the X3 programming language. The goal is to empower developers with the tools and knowledge they need to effectively utilize X3 for a variety of purposes, including automation, data manipulation, API interaction, and more. Whether you're just getting started or looking to dive deeper into advanced concepts, this documentation aims to make learning and mastering X3 accessible and enjoyable.

### 🔍 What is X3?

X3 is a programming language designed to be simple and intuitive for handling operations like variable management, arithmetic calculations, control flow, and data fetching from APIs. It's particularly useful for scripting, building custom command interpreters, and rapid prototyping.

## 🌟 Features

- 📜 **Detailed Syntax Guide**: Learn about the core syntax and structure of X3, covering everything from basic data types to complex expressions.
- ⚙️ **Command Reference**: A complete list of available commands with detailed descriptions, parameters, and practical examples for each command.
- 🔄 **Control Flow & Error Handling**: Learn how to write complex conditional logic using `if`, `else`, `while`, and nested loops, while ensuring proper error handling and avoiding common pitfalls.
- 🌐 **API Data Fetching**: Use X3 to make HTTP requests and fetch data from APIs, storing responses in variables for further processing.
- 🧹 **Variable Management**: Understand how to declare, assign, and manipulate variables efficiently, including dynamic type management and memory handling.
- 🧪 **Practical Examples**: Real-world examples to help you understand how to apply X3 in automation, data processing, and more.
- 📊 **Integrated Testing**: Built-in testing framework for testing scripts, allowing you to verify the functionality of your X3 code before deployment.

## 🏁 Getting Started

To get started with X3, visit the documentation website: [x3documentation.neocities.org](https://x3documentation.neocities.org).

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x (for running the X3 interpreter)
- A code editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) (recommended)
- Basic knowledge of programming concepts is helpful but not mandatory

### Installation

To use the X3 interpreter locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/x3documentation.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**:

    ```sh
    cd x3documentation
    ```

3. **Run the X3 Interpreter**:

    ```sh
    python x3_interpreter.py your_script.x3
    ```

4. **Set Up in VS Code** (optional):
   - Set up a task in VS Code to automatically run `.x3` files using the X3 interpreter.

### Hello World Example

Below is a simple "Hello World" program written in X3:

```x3
print "Hello, World!"

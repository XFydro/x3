## What's Sardonix??

**Sardonix** is a lightweight and efficient(less beefy) version of **MintEclipse v3.94**, designed with medium level compatibility with v3.94, with a well defined abstract syntax tree and better tokenisation system.

Built by **[Raven (formally known as XFydro)](https://x3documentation.neocities.org/developer)** with enthusiasm and insanity >:3.

## 🛠️ Usage

### 💻 Run a Script
```bash
python "C:/.../sardonix.py" "-f" "script.x3"
```
If you do have the interpreter installed on PATH (you can use our **[installer](https://github.com/XFydro/x3/releases/tag/SardonixIns1.4)** for that :3 )
```bash
xs3 -f "./script.x3"
```
